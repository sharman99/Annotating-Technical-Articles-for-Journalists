Its most recent designation, African American Language (AAL), reflects a change in approaches to studying race and language in the field.

[0]     'The influence of African Americans‚Äô speech on the development of sociolinguistics has been significant since its earliest descriptions within this discipline in the late 1960s (Labov et al. 1968, Wolfram 1969). Rickford (1997b) and others have been critical of the unequal partnership between researchers of African American Vernacular English (AAVE) and African American speech communities given the myriad of theoretical innovations that data from AAVE speakers have contributed to the field. Some examples include ‚Äúthe development of variable rules and frameworks for the analysis of tense-aspect markers, social class, styles, narratives, and speech events‚Äù (Rickford 1997b, p. 161). Despite the field‚Äôs generation of these theoretical and analytic tools, much remains to be gleaned from our observations of these communities, and much remains to be returned to them. Specifically, we should document and represent the language patterns of the African American community more broadly while also implementing various social justice aims. The need to reconsider our scholarly approaches to racialized varieties like African American Language (AAL), and to include and consider more racialized participants in the process of knowledge production, is evident in the Linguistic Society of America‚Äôs move to craft a Statement on Race addressing these goals (Charity Hudley et al. 2019). Toward this end, the goal of this review is to rethink the relationship between race and language via the study of AAVE and thereby address broader sociolinguistic and sociopolitical concerns. To understand the relationship between race and language in the field, I trace what Wolfram (2015) has called ‚Äúthe sociolinguistic construction of African American Language.‚Äù I discuss the field‚Äôs larger objectives and controversies while also considering the subjectivity of racialized participants. A bird‚Äôs eye view of how African Americans have been historically situated in relation to the variety will inform the new questions we develop as well as the kinds of approaches we use to answer them. Specifically, we can ask how to relate scholars‚Äô larger goals of AAL and sociolinguistics to the goals of the African American communities in which we are engaged (Charity Hudley 2017). 2. THE HISTORICAL LANDSCAPE 2.1. Labeling the Variety A review of the field‚Äôs approaches to studying African Americans‚Äô speech should first address linguists‚Äô naming practices of the variety over the last five decades. Various titles of the dialect will carry different kinds of ideological baggage that necessarily interact with the changing social climate (Green 2002, Smitherman 1991, Wassink & Curzan 2004). Broadly, the name used for the dialect serves three functions: identifying the racial group whose language production is being described, indicating the variety‚Äôs relationship to English and creoles, and specifying the subset of African Americans whose language is being characterized (Green 2002). With respect to the first function, the name can reflect how members of the racial group are referenced or refer to themselves. For instance, earlier versions of the variety, such as Negro dialect, Nonstandard Negro English, and Negro English, enlist an identifying term that has become obsolete as speakers have opted for black or African American. As such, the identifying terms used by members of the racial group under',
    'are mixed, with African Americans rejecting or adopting various aspects of the regional dialect and some speakers taking up the vocalic patterns more than others in their communities. 2.3. Against the Uniformity Assumption Earlier explorations of AAVE aimed to legitimize the variety by packaging a particular set of linguistic variables racialized as black. Referencing such linguistic behavior as a single object of study enabled sociolinguists to address linguistic discrimination that black people faced in education, housing, employment, and law settings. Sociolinguists believed that by showing systematic and cross-regional patterns, they could combat claims that this speech style was ungrammatical. Under these approaches, the sociolinguistic construction of AAVE relied on the presentation of a uniform, systematic dialect. However, more recent approaches aimed at understanding the development and change of the dialect over time have begun to elucidate the variation. The new observations that emerged from using these new techniques led to the critique that sociolinguists were homogenizing the linguistic practices and identities of African Americans across and within speech communities and problematized the notion that sociolinguists were studying a single www.annualreviews.org ‚Ä¢ From AAVE to AAL 289 Annu. Rev. Linguist. 2020.6:285-300. Downloaded from www.annualreviews.org Access provided by Stanford University Main Campus Robert Crown Law Library on 02/18/20. For personal use only. LI06CH14_King ARjats.cls November 27, 2019 15:23 dialect (Wolfram 2007). Despite sociolinguists‚Äô good intentions, some of their generalizations about African Americans‚Äô speech had unintended consequences. As Bucholtz (2003, p. 402) notes, But the recognition of AAVE and its speakers necessitated a series of simplifications that reduced the complexity of AAVE users to a subset of the entire community and reduced the complexity of African American language use to a subset of the community‚Äôs entire repertoire. Such simplifications were certainly not intended to be the full story but instead functioned as strategies that allowed sociolinguists to intervene in a high-stakes sociopolitical issue despite very real constraints. The issue of homogenization is a question of whose speech is considered representative of the black experience. As is evident in earlier instantiations of the dialect‚Äôs name, researchers were aiming to study a specific sample of the African American population: young people in inner cities, especially young men (Labov 1972). Thus, AAVE‚Äôs close association with working-class, black, male identity is no surprise given our field‚Äôs foundational studies, which reflect our larger society‚Äôs beliefs about who speaks AAVE. Put differently, the fact that the speech of young black men from inner cities defines the field says as much about conceptualizations of what blackness is as it does about who is seen as the most authentic speaker of the variety. This construction of the ideal or imagined speaker is meaningful and cannot be divorced from the ways in which those speakers are positioned in the society. As Wassink & Curzan (2004, p. 181) describe, ‚Äú‚ÄòYoung, Black, male, and dangerous‚Äô continues to be an important social construct for dominant America. Many Americans hold an ideology that marks that construct by associating it with a way of speaking, among other behaviors.‚Äù The critique of older approaches‚Äô centering of African American male experiences was advanced as early as the late 1980s when Smitherman (1988) argued against overrepresenting young black men at the expense of studying black women‚Äôs linguistic behavior. Further, the continued focus on negative aspects of street culture reinforced negative stereotypes associated with African Americans (Rickford 1997b, Smitherman 1988). Morgan (1994, p. 138) also has asked whether ‚Äúthe language styles purported to describe the African American community represent the entire social field.‚Äù These concerns highlight the ways in which representation has become increasingly important in the study of the dialect. Given the historical landscape of the field, our research must meet the foundational goal of AAVE scholars (documenting the stigmatized speech patterns of African Americans) while also not essentializing or misrepresenting African Americans‚Äô wide array of linguistic practices and identities (King & Rosa 2019). These goals may seem contradictory if we believe that showing variation across the dialect weakens its legitimacy. However, we can still discuss the systematic ways in which language varies among racialized individuals both linguistically and socially while understanding which of those features, or styles, become indexical of blackness and why. An analysis of our theoretical commitments in the broader study of race and language will help us to develop and adopt the necessary analytic tools. Further, an explicit articulation of African Americans‚Äô subjectivity will elucidate how we can study and value linguistic diversity among this population and address the linguistic discrimination faced by its most marginalized and civically vulnerable speakers. 3. THE TRAJECTORY OF AAL 3.1. Understanding the Relationships Between Race and Language What does it mean to study race in sociolinguistics? How has our approach to documenting African Americans‚Äô language patterns evolved across the field? In this review, I draw on knowledge 290 King Annu. Rev. Linguist. 2020.6:285-300. Downloaded from www.annualreviews.org Access provided by Stanford University Main Campus Robert Crown Law Library on 02/18/20. For personal use only. LI06CH14_King ARjats.cls November 27, 2019 15:23 from contiguous fields like linguistic anthropology, sociology, and critical race theory to suggest how we should approach the study of race in sociolinguistics. The changes that have occurred across the study of the dialect reflect the dynamic nature of the field‚Äôs conceptualizations of African American identity and African Americans‚Äô language and the relationship between the two. The recent call for a statement on race within linguistics reflects the felt need of sociolinguists, educators, and linguistic anthropologists for a cohesive model of race in the field (Charity Hudley et al. 2019). While sociolinguists may have understood their research on African Americans‚Äô speech to only concern descriptions of language, they have, perhaps unreflexively, subscribed to particular theories of race and identity and participated in the construction of this racialized language. A review of the field‚Äôs approaches to studying race and language will elucidate the theoretical constructs AAL scholars have employed to analyze and represent African Americans‚Äô speech and will also highlight the consequences of such approaches. The field has two predominant approaches: the dialect orientation and the group orientation (Alim & Reyes 2011). Under the dialect orientation, linguists begin with the dialect and are ‚Äúconcerned with classifying the frequency and distinctiveness of dialect features with respect to some ethnoracial formation‚Äù (Alim & Reyes 2011, p. 380). A hazard of this approach is the one-to-one mapping it creates between the dialect and the racial group: Investigations of the dialect only look at African American speakers.Additional complications extend from earlier critiques regarding the essentialization of African Americans‚Äô speech. If a set of behaviors racialized as African American is defined against an imagined standard, MAE, which is racialized as white, then we foreground interracial comparisons at the cost of exploring intraracial comparisons. The foregrounded point of comparison between AAVE and MAE can obscure the variation within each group and imply that African Americans who are not proficient in ethnolectal patterns do not have legitimate membership in the racial category and are not worthy of study. Sociolinguists have opposed this idea using the caveat that not all speakers of AAVE are black and not all black people are AAVE speakers (Benor 2010, Green 2002). Others have noted that the dialect approach supports outdated taxonomic models of race by assuming a direct relationship between one‚Äôs racial identity and the racialized variety (Charity Hudley 2017, Smedley 1999). This dialect approach favors the ethnolect as a theoretical construct to understand the linguistic behavior of racialized individuals. However, Benor (2010) proposes the ‚Äúethnolinguistic repertoire‚Äù as a means of addressing some of the issues posed by the dialect approach. The linguistic repertoire was first proposed by Gumperz (1964), but in Benor‚Äôs (2010, p. 160) recapitulation of the term, it is defined as a ‚Äúfluid set of linguistic resources that members of an ethnic group may use variably as they index their ethnic identities.‚Äù In an effort to treat ethnic identity as more fluid, this particular theoretical model allows for in-group variation and intraspeaker variation such that speakers can draw on variables from an arsenal of racialized features. Further, this model acknowledges racialized speakers‚Äô agency as they engage in the process of bricolage (Eckert 2000). However, the extent to which the ethnolinguistic repertoire captures the ability of racialized variables to index identities beyond race has been called into question. Becker (2014) argues for a more general approach to the repertoire in her examination of an individual African American woman from Harlem. Becker‚Äôs analyses show that a single speaker can employ any feature from their repertoire, whether ‚Äúethnolectal‚Äù or not, to construct race and a range of other identities. For example, an AAVE feature, like copula deletion, can be used to construct place identity, while a regional feature, like bought raising, can be used to mark racial identity. Becker‚Äôs approach to studying the variables recruited in the identity constructions across an individual speaker is consistent with what Alim & Reyes (2011) call the group orientation. This approach begins with specific ethnoracial information about a group or speaker and examines the emergence of linguistic practices among members of that group. Alim & Reyes (2011, p. 380) note www.annualreviews.org ‚Ä¢ From AAVE to AAL 291 Annu. Rev. Linguist. 2020.6:285-300. Downloaded from www.annualreviews.org Access provided by Stanford University Main Campus Robert Crown Law Library on 02/18/20. For personal use only.

The diagram represents the difference between ( a ) dialect orientation [in this example, studying African American Vernacular English (AAVE)] and ( b ) group orientation (in this example, studying African Americans‚Äô speech). The former approach emphasizes observing the canonical features of a dialect, whereas the latter emphasizes observing the breadth of African Americans‚Äô linguistic practices. The group orientation also demonstrates that the canonical AAVE features can covary with features that are not exclusive to AAVE, producing a range of styles across the racial group. that this approach allows for ‚Äúethnic identity to be produced without an ethnic dialect‚Äù and necessarily changes how we think about African American speakers in relation to linguistic variation. Without presupposing a set of linguistic behaviors that we expect African Americans to follow, we avoid assuming that the speakers who produce the most AAVE patterns give the most authentic performance of African American identity. Figure 1 illustrates the differences between the two approaches with an emphasis on what can be studied using each approach. The difference in the orientations can be reflected in the questions ‚ÄúWho is an AAVE speaker?‚Äù versus ‚ÄúWhat are the linguistic resources African Americans are recruiting in their construction of identities?‚Äù Under the guise of the latter question, the study of African Americans‚Äô speech need not only include features associated with the ethnolect. Highlighting the differences does not negate the initial approach‚Äôs contributions to our understanding of race and language; rather, it is a window into how the racial group is situated in relation to its language patterns. Alim & Reyes (2011) recommend departing from both orientations and transcending the larger macrosocial categories to understand the construction of race and the process of racialization (Charity Hudley 2017). We can learn more about how race is constituted through linguistic practice (Eckert 2000) while also understanding how it informs and is necessarily informed by other dimensions of identity, such as speakers‚Äô age, nationality, gender, and sexuality (Alim & Reyes 2011, p. 381). This change mirrors the larger transition in sociolinguistics from correlating variables with fixed macrosocial categories to studying the ways in which variables come to indirectly index these categories via associated qualities and stances (Eckert 2008, 2012). For AAL to arrive at third-wave variationism, we must draw on the theoretic constructs that view language not as a static like the ethnolect but, rather, as a process of meaning making. That is, we can discuss linguistic variation across African Americans, as well as how specific linguistic patterns have come to be racialized, by drawing on third-wave theoretical constructs like indexicality (Eckert 2008, Silverstein 2003) and the persona (Agha 2003, Podesva 2007, Zhang 2005), which emphasize the 292 King Annu. Rev. Linguist. 2020.6:285-300. Downloaded from www.annualreviews.org Access provided by Stanford University Main Campus Robert Crown Law Library on 02/18/20. For personal use only. LI06CH14_King ARjats.cls November 27, 2019 15:23 social meaning of variables and the ways in which variables combine to produce styles that have become legible as black and African American. These goals fall within the perimeter of raciolinguistics, which seeks to understand how speakers use language to construct race and how race constructs language (Alim et al. 2016, Flores & Rosa 2015). If the primary concern of AAL is to document the breadth of speech among African Americans without homogenizing the speech community, then future studies should investigate the emergence of linguistic variables among African American speakers and identify which of these variables become indexical of race and other co-constructed dimensions of identity.The group orientation provides a starting point to discuss the features associated with African American identity as well as those that are not. This reframing expands our descriptive power for a dialect that, paradoxically, is overrepresented in sociolinguistic literature (Morgan 2002) but underdocumented in terms of its variation across different linguistic domains and social dimensions. One might argue against this approach because it relies on African Americans‚Äô subscribing to taxonomic categories of race by identifying themselves as black. However, part of undoing the singular narrative of blackness relies on discovering the expanse of social and linguistic practices among speakers who identify as black. As a heterogeneous collectivity, African Americans share the experience of being racialized as belonging to the same demographic category, but they need not share the same social constructions of race, and African American individuals can perform their racial identities in diverse ways (Collins 2000, King 2018). Therefore, dismantling stereotypes and raciolinguistic ideologies (Flores & Rosa 2015) requires understanding how the racial category is constituted via social and language variation. 3.2. A Multidimensional Approach Toward Studying Race in AAL Resituating racial groups in relation to their speech changes what subjectivity should look like for African Americans in our analyses. With the emergence of new research questions around the construction of racialized language and racial identities, researchers must reconsider whom and what we investigate, looking beyond the traditionally studied AAVE speakers and beyond AAVE. In essence, we must reconsider which African Americans are represented and investigate linguistic features beyond or in addition to the canonical AAVE variables. This reconsideration affects analytic and methodological approaches to data collection and data analyses (Blake 2014, Charity Hudley 2017).Specifically,ethnographic'

Referencing such linguistic behavior as a single object of study enabled sociolinguists to address linguistic discrimination that black people faced in education, housing, employment, and law settings. Sociolinguists believed that by showing systematic and cross-regional patterns, they could combat claims that this speech style was ungrammatical. Under these approaches, the sociolinguistic construction of AAVE relied on the presentation of a uniform, systematic dialect. However, more recent approaches aimed at understanding the development and change of the dialect over time have begun to elucidate the variation. The new observations that emerged from using these new techniques led to the critique that sociolinguists were homogenizing the linguistic practices and identities of African Americans across and within speech communities and problematized the notion that sociolinguists were studying a single www.annualreviews.org ‚Ä¢ From AAVE to AAL 289 Annu.

Despite sociolinguists‚Äô good intentions, some of their generalizations about African Americans‚Äô speech had unintended consequences. As Bucholtz (2003, p. 402) notes, But the recognition of AAVE and its speakers necessitated a series of simplifications that reduced the complexity of AAVE users to a subset of the entire community and reduced the complexity of African American language use to a subset of the community‚Äôs entire repertoire. Such simplifications were certainly not intended to be the full story but instead functioned as strategies that allowed sociolinguists to intervene in a high-stakes sociopolitical issue despite very real constraints. The issue of homogenization is a question of whose speech is considered representative of the black experience. As is evident in earlier instantiations of the dialect‚Äôs name, researchers were aiming to study a specific sample of the African American population: young people in inner cities, especially young men (Labov 1972). Thus, AAVE‚Äôs close association with working-class, black, male identity is no surprise given our field‚Äôs foundational studies, which reflect our larger society‚Äôs beliefs about who speaks AAVE. Put differently, the fact that the speech of young black men from inner cities defines the field says as much about conceptualizations of what blackness is as it does about who is seen as the most authentic speaker of the variety. This construction of the ideal or imagined speaker is meaningful and cannot be divorced from the ways in which those speakers are positioned in the society. As Wassink & Curzan (2004, p. 181) describe, ‚Äú‚ÄòYoung, Black, male, and dangerous‚Äô continues to be an important social construct for dominant America. Many Americans hold an ideology that marks that construct by associating it with a way of speaking, among other behaviors.‚Äù The critique of older approaches‚Äô centering of African American male experiences was advanced as early as the late 1980s when Smitherman (1988) argued against overrepresenting young black men at the expense of studying black women‚Äôs linguistic behavior. Further, the continued focus on negative aspects of street culture reinforced negative stereotypes associated with African Americans (Rickford 1997b, Smitherman 1988). Morgan (1994, p. 138) also has asked whether ‚Äúthe language styles purported to describe the African American community represent the entire social field.‚Äù These concerns highlight the ways in which representation has become increasingly important in the study of the dialect. Given the historical landscape of the field, our research must meet the foundational goal of AAVE scholars (documenting the stigmatized speech patterns of African Americans) while also not essentializing or misrepresenting African Americans‚Äô wide array of linguistic practices and identities (King & Rosa 2019). These goals may seem contradictory if we believe that showing variation across the dialect weakens its legitimacy. However, we can still discuss the systematic ways in which language varies among racialized individuals both linguistically and socially while understanding which of those features, or styles, become indexical of blackness and why. An analysis of our theoretical commitments in the broader study of race and language will help us to develop and adopt the necessary analytic tools. Further, an explicit articulation of African Americans‚Äô subjectivity will elucidate how we can study and value linguistic diversity among this population and address the linguistic discrimination faced by its most marginalized and civically vulnerable speakers. 3. THE TRAJECTORY OF AAL 3.1. Understanding the Relationships Between Race and Language What does it mean to study race in sociolinguistics? How has our approach to documenting African Americans‚Äô language patterns evolved across the field? In this review, I draw on knowledge 290 King Annu. Rev. Linguist. 2020.6:285-300. Downloaded from www.annualreviews.org Access provided by Stanford University Main Campus Robert Crown Law Library on 02/18/20. For personal use only. LI06CH14_King ARjats.cls November 27, 2019 15:23 from contiguous fields like linguistic anthropology, sociology, and critical race theory to suggest how we should approach the study of race in sociolinguistics. The changes that have occurred across the study of the dialect reflect the dynamic nature of the field‚Äôs conceptualizations of African American identity and African Americans‚Äô language and the relationship between the two. The recent call for a statement on race within linguistics reflects the felt need of sociolinguists, educators, and linguistic anthropologists for a cohesive model of race in the field (Charity Hudley et al. 2019). While sociolinguists may have understood their research on African Americans‚Äô speech to only concern descriptions of language, they have, perhaps unreflexively, subscribed to particular theories of race and identity and participated in the construction of this racialized language. A review of the field‚Äôs approaches to studying race and language will elucidate the theoretical constructs AAL scholars have employed to analyze and represent African Americans‚Äô speech and will also highlight the consequences of such approaches. The field has two predominant approaches: the dialect orientation and the group orientation (Alim & Reyes 2011). Under the dialect orientation, linguists begin with the dialect and are ‚Äúconcerned with classifying the frequency and distinctiveness of dialect features with respect to some ethnoracial formation‚Äù (Alim & Reyes 2011, p. 380). A hazard of this approach is the one-to-one mapping it creates between the dialect and the racial group: Investigations of the dialect only look at African American speakers.Additional complications extend from earlier critiques regarding the essentialization of African Americans‚Äô speech. If a set of behaviors racialized as African American is defined against an imagined standard, MAE, which is racialized as white, then we foreground interracial comparisons at the cost of exploring intraracial comparisons. The foregrounded point of comparison between AAVE and MAE can obscure the variation within each group and imply that African Americans who are not proficient in ethnolectal patterns do not have legitimate membership in the racial category and are not worthy of study. Sociolinguists have opposed this idea using the caveat that not all speakers of AAVE are black and not all black people are AAVE speakers (Benor 2010, Green 2002). Others have noted that the dialect approach supports outdated taxonomic models of race by assuming a direct relationship between one‚Äôs racial identity and the racialized variety (Charity Hudley 2017, Smedley 1999). This dialect approach favors the ethnolect as a theoretical construct to understand the linguistic behavior of racialized individuals. However, Benor (2010) proposes the ‚Äúethnolinguistic repertoire‚Äù as a means of addressing some of the issues posed by the dialect approach. The linguistic repertoire was first proposed by Gumperz (1964), but in Benor‚Äôs (2010, p. 160) recapitulation of the term, it is defined as a ‚Äúfluid set of linguistic resources that members of an ethnic group may use variably as they index their ethnic identities.‚Äù In an effort to treat ethnic identity as more fluid, this particular theoretical model allows for in-group variation and intraspeaker variation such that speakers can draw on variables from an arsenal of racialized features. Further, this model acknowledges racialized speakers‚Äô agency as they engage in the process of bricolage (Eckert 2000). However, the extent to which the ethnolinguistic repertoire captures the ability of racialized variables to index identities beyond race has been called into question. Becker (2014) argues for a more general approach to the repertoire in her examination of an individual African American woman from Harlem. Becker‚Äôs analyses show that a single speaker can employ any feature from their repertoire, whether ‚Äúethnolectal‚Äù or not, to construct race and a range of other identities. For example, an AAVE feature, like copula deletion, can be used to construct place identity, while a regional feature, like bought raising, can be used to mark racial identity. Becker‚Äôs approach to studying the variables recruited in the identity constructions across an individual speaker is consistent with what Alim & Reyes (2011) call the group orientation. This approach begins with specific ethnoracial information about a group or speaker and examines the emergence of linguistic practices among members of that group.

The diagram represents the difference between ( a ) dialect orientation [in this example, studying African American Vernacular English (AAVE)] and ( b ) group orientation (in this example, studying African Americans‚Äô speech). The former approach emphasizes observing the canonical features of a dialect, whereas the latter emphasizes observing the breadth of African Americans‚Äô linguistic practices. The group orientation also demonstrates that the canonical AAVE features can covary with features that are not exclusive to AAVE, producing a range of styles across the racial group. that this approach allows for ‚Äúethnic identity to be produced without an ethnic dialect‚Äù and necessarily changes how we think about African American speakers in relation to linguistic variation. Without presupposing a set of linguistic behaviors that we expect African Americans to follow, we avoid assuming that the speakers who produce the most AAVE patterns give the most authentic performance of African American identity. Figure 1 illustrates the differences between the two approaches with an emphasis on what can be studied using each approach. The difference in the orientations can be reflected in the questions ‚ÄúWho is an AAVE speaker?‚Äù versus ‚ÄúWhat are the linguistic resources African Americans are recruiting in their construction of identities?‚Äù Under the guise of the latter question, the study of African Americans‚Äô speech need not only include features associated with the ethnolect. Highlighting the differences does not negate the initial approach‚Äôs contributions to our understanding of race and language; rather, it is a window into how the racial group is situated in relation to its language patterns. Alim & Reyes (2011) recommend departing from both orientations and transcending the larger macrosocial categories to understand the construction of race and the process of racialization (Charity Hudley 2017). We can learn more about how race is constituted through linguistic practice (Eckert 2000) while also understanding how it informs and is necessarily informed by other dimensions of identity, such as speakers‚Äô age, nationality, gender, and sexuality (Alim & Reyes 2011, p. 381). This change mirrors the larger transition in sociolinguistics from correlating variables with fixed macrosocial categories to studying the ways in which variables come to indirectly index these categories via associated qualities and stances (Eckert 2008, 2012). For AAL to arrive at third-wave variationism, we must draw on the theoretic constructs that view language not as a static like the ethnolect but, rather, as a process of meaning making. That is, we can discuss linguistic variation across African Americans, as well as how specific linguistic patterns have come to be racialized, by drawing on third-wave theoretical constructs like indexicality (Eckert 2008, Silverstein 2003) and the persona (Agha 2003, Podesva 2007, Zhang 2005), which emphasize the 292 King Annu.

LI06CH14_King ARjats.cls November 27, 2019 15:23 social meaning of variables and the ways in which variables combine to produce styles that have become legible as black and African American. These goals fall within the perimeter of raciolinguistics, which seeks to understand how speakers use language to construct race and how race constructs language (Alim et al. 2016, Flores & Rosa 2015). If the primary concern of AAL is to document the breadth of speech among African Americans without homogenizing the speech community, then future studies should investigate the emergence of linguistic variables among African American speakers and identify which of these variables become indexical of race and other co-constructed dimensions of identity.The group orientation provides a starting point to discuss the features associated with African American identity as well as those that are not. This reframing expands our descriptive power for a dialect that, paradoxically, is overrepresented in sociolinguistic literature (Morgan 2002) but underdocumented in terms of its variation across different linguistic domains and social dimensions. One might argue against this approach because it relies on African Americans‚Äô subscribing to taxonomic categories of race by identifying themselves as black. However, part of undoing the singular narrative of blackness relies on discovering the expanse of social and linguistic practices among speakers who identify as black. As a heterogeneous collectivity, African Americans share the experience of being racialized as belonging to the same demographic category, but they need not share the same social constructions of race, and African American individuals can perform their racial identities in diverse ways (Collins 2000, King 2018). Therefore, dismantling stereotypes and raciolinguistic ideologies (Flores & Rosa 2015) requires understanding how the racial category is constituted via social and language variation. 3.2. A Multidimensional Approach Toward Studying Race in AAL Resituating racial groups in relation to their speech changes what subjectivity should look like for African Americans in our analyses. With the emergence of new research questions around the construction of racialized language and racial identities, researchers must reconsider whom and what we investigate, looking beyond the traditionally studied AAVE speakers and beyond AAVE. In essence, we must reconsider which African Americans are represented and investigate linguistic features beyond or in addition to the canonical AAVE variables. This reconsideration affects analytic and methodological approaches to data collection and data analyses (Blake 2014, Charity Hudley 2017).Specifically,ethnographic'

[0]       'The influence of African Americans‚Äô speech on the development of sociolinguistics has been significant since its earliest descriptions within this discipline in the late 1960s (Labov et al. 1968, Wolfram 1969). Rickford (1997b) and others have been critical of the unequal partnership between researchers of African American Vernacular English (AAVE) and African American speech communities given the myriad of theoretical innovations that data from AAVE speakers have contributed to the field. Some examples include ‚Äúthe development of variable rules and frameworks for the analysis of tense-aspect markers, social class, styles, narratives, and speech events‚Äù (Rickford 1997b, p. 161). Despite the field‚Äôs generation of these theoretical and analytic tools, much remains to be gleaned from our observations of these communities, and much remains to be returned to them. Specifically, we should document and represent the language patterns of the African American community more broadly while also implementing various social justice aims. The need to reconsider our scholarly approaches to racialized varieties like African American Language (AAL), and to include and consider more racialized participants in the process of knowledge production, is evident in the Linguistic Society of America‚Äôs move to craft a Statement on Race addressing these goals (Charity Hudley et al. 2019). Toward this end, the goal of this review is to rethink the relationship between race and language via the study of AAVE and thereby address broader sociolinguistic and sociopolitical concerns. To understand the relationship between race and language in the field, I trace what Wolfram (2015) has called ‚Äúthe sociolinguistic construction of African American Language.‚Äù I discuss the field‚Äôs larger objectives and controversies while also considering the subjectivity of racialized participants. A bird‚Äôs eye view of how African Americans have been historically situated in relation to the variety will inform the new questions we develop as well as the kinds of approaches we use to answer them. Specifically, we can ask how to relate scholars‚Äô larger goals of AAL and sociolinguistics to the goals of the African American communities in which we are engaged (Charity Hudley 2017). 2. THE HISTORICAL LANDSCAPE 2.1. Labeling the Variety A review of the field‚Äôs approaches to studying African Americans‚Äô speech should first address linguists‚Äô naming practices of the variety over the last five decades. Various titles of the dialect will carry different kinds of ideological baggage that necessarily interact with the changing social climate (Green 2002, Smitherman 1991, Wassink & Curzan 2004). Broadly, the name used for the dialect serves three functions: identifying the racial group whose language production is being described, indicating the variety‚Äôs relationship to English and creoles, and specifying the subset of African Americans whose language is being characterized (Green 2002). With respect to the first function, the name can reflect how members of the racial group are referenced or refer to themselves. For instance, earlier versions of the variety, such as Negro dialect, Nonstandard Negro English, and Negro English, enlist an identifying term that has become obsolete as speakers have opted for black or African American. As such, the identifying terms used by members of the racial group under',
      'are mixed, with African Americans rejecting or adopting various aspects of the regional dialect and some speakers taking up the vocalic patterns more than others in their communities. 2.3. Against the Uniformity Assumption Earlier explorations of AAVE aimed to legitimize the variety by packaging a particular set of linguistic variables racialized as black. Referencing such linguistic behavior as a single object of study enabled sociolinguists to address linguistic discrimination that black people faced in education, housing, employment, and law settings. Sociolinguists believed that by showing systematic and cross-regional patterns, they could combat claims that this speech style was ungrammatical. Under these approaches, the sociolinguistic construction of AAVE relied on the presentation of a uniform, systematic dialect. However, more recent approaches aimed at understanding the development and change of the dialect over time have begun to elucidate the variation.

However, part of undoing the singular narrative of blackness relies on discovering the expanse of social and linguistic practices among speakers who identify as black. As a heterogeneous collectivity, African Americans share the experience of being racialized as belonging to the same demographic category, but they need not share the same social constructions of race, and African American individuals can perform their racial identities in diverse ways (Collins 2000, King 2018). Therefore, dismantling stereotypes and raciolinguistic ideologies (Flores & Rosa 2015) requires understanding how the racial category is constituted via social and language variation. 3.2. A Multidimensional Approach Toward Studying Race in AAL Resituating racial groups in relation to their speech changes what subjectivity should look like for African Americans in our analyses. With the emergence of new research questions around the construction of racialized language and racial identities, researchers must reconsider whom and what we investigate, looking beyond the traditionally studied AAVE speakers and beyond AAVE. In essence, we must reconsider which African Americans are represented and investigate linguistic features beyond or in addition to the canonical AAVE variables.

[0]     'The influence of African Americans‚Äô speech on the development of sociolinguistics has been significant since its earliest descriptions within this discipline in the late 1960s (Labov et al. 1968, Wolfram 1969). Rickford (1997b) and others have been critical of the unequal partnership between researchers of African American Vernacular English (AAVE) and African American speech communities given the myriad of theoretical innovations that data from AAVE speakers have contributed to the field. Some examples include ‚Äúthe development of variable rules and frameworks for the analysis of tense-aspect markers, social class, styles, narratives, and speech events‚Äù (Rickford 1997b, p. 161). Despite the field‚Äôs generation of these theoretical and analytic tools, much remains to be gleaned from our observations of these communities, and much remains to be returned to them. Specifically, we should document and represent the language patterns of the African American community more broadly while also implementing various social justice aims. The need to reconsider our scholarly approaches to racialized varieties like African American Language (AAL), and to include and consider more racialized participants in the process of knowledge production, is evident in the Linguistic Society of America‚Äôs move to craft a Statement on Race addressing these goals (Charity Hudley et al. 2019). Toward this end, the goal of this review is to rethink the relationship between race and language via the study of AAVE and thereby address broader sociolinguistic and sociopolitical concerns. To understand the relationship between race and language in the field, I trace what Wolfram (2015) has called ‚Äúthe sociolinguistic construction of African American Language.‚Äù I discuss the field‚Äôs larger objectives and controversies while also considering the subjectivity of racialized participants. A bird‚Äôs eye view of how African Americans have been historically situated in relation to the variety will inform the new questions we develop as well as the kinds of approaches we use to answer them. Specifically, we can ask how to relate scholars‚Äô larger goals of AAL and sociolinguistics to the goals of the African American communities in which we are engaged (Charity Hudley 2017). 2. THE HISTORICAL LANDSCAPE 2.1. Labeling the Variety A review of the field‚Äôs approaches to studying African Americans‚Äô speech should first address linguists‚Äô naming practices of the variety over the last five decades. Various titles of the dialect will carry different kinds of ideological baggage that necessarily interact with the changing social climate (Green 2002, Smitherman 1991, Wassink & Curzan 2004). Broadly, the name used for the dialect serves three functions: identifying the racial group whose language production is being described, indicating the variety‚Äôs relationship to English and creoles, and specifying the subset of African Americans whose language is being characterized (Green 2002). With respect to the first function, the name can reflect how members of the racial group are referenced or refer to themselves. For instance, earlier versions of the variety, such as Negro dialect, Nonstandard Negro English, and Negro English, enlist an identifying term that has become obsolete as speakers have opted for black or African American. As such, the identifying terms used by members of the racial group under',
    'are mixed, with African Americans rejecting or adopting various aspects of the regional dialect and some speakers taking up the vocalic patterns more than others in their communities. 2.3. Against the Uniformity Assumption Earlier explorations of AAVE aimed to legitimize the variety by packaging a particular set of linguistic variables racialized as black. Referencing such linguistic behavior as a single object of study enabled sociolinguists to address linguistic discrimination that black people faced in education, housing, employment, and law settings. Sociolinguists believed that by showing systematic and cross-regional patterns, they could combat claims that this speech style was ungrammatical. Under these approaches, the sociolinguistic construction of AAVE relied on the presentation of a uniform, systematic dialect. However, more recent approaches aimed at understanding the development and change of the dialect over time have begun to elucidate the variation. The new observations that emerged from using these new techniques led to the critique that sociolinguists were homogenizing the linguistic practices and identities of African Americans across and within speech communities and problematized the notion that sociolinguists were studying a single www.annualreviews.org ‚Ä¢ From AAVE to AAL 289 Annu. Rev. Linguist. 2020.6:285-300. Downloaded from www.annualreviews.org Access provided by Stanford University Main Campus Robert Crown Law Library on 02/18/20. For personal use only. LI06CH14_King ARjats.cls November 27, 2019 15:23 dialect (Wolfram 2007). Despite sociolinguists‚Äô good intentions, some of their generalizations about African Americans‚Äô speech had unintended consequences. As Bucholtz (2003, p. 402) notes, But the recognition of AAVE and its speakers necessitated a series of simplifications that reduced the complexity of AAVE users to a subset of the entire community and reduced the complexity of African American language use to a subset of the community‚Äôs entire repertoire. Such simplifications were certainly not intended to be the full story but instead functioned as strategies that allowed sociolinguists to intervene in a high-stakes sociopolitical issue despite very real constraints. The issue of homogenization is a question of whose speech is considered representative of the black experience. As is evident in earlier instantiations of the dialect‚Äôs name, researchers were aiming to study a specific sample of the African American population: young people in inner cities, especially young men (Labov 1972). Thus, AAVE‚Äôs close association with working-class, black, male identity is no surprise given our field‚Äôs foundational studies, which reflect our larger society‚Äôs beliefs about who speaks AAVE. Put differently, the fact that the speech of young black men from inner cities defines the field says as much about conceptualizations of what blackness is as it does about who is seen as the most authentic speaker of the variety. This construction of the ideal or imagined speaker is meaningful and cannot be divorced from the ways in which those speakers are positioned in the society. As Wassink & Curzan (2004, p. 181) describe, ‚Äú‚ÄòYoung, Black, male, and dangerous‚Äô continues to be an important social construct for dominant America. Many Americans hold an ideology that marks that construct by associating it with a way of speaking, among other behaviors.‚Äù The critique of older approaches‚Äô centering of African American male experiences was advanced as early as the late 1980s when Smitherman (1988) argued against overrepresenting young black men at the expense of studying black women‚Äôs linguistic behavior. Further, the continued focus on negative aspects of street culture reinforced negative stereotypes associated with African Americans (Rickford 1997b, Smitherman 1988). Morgan (1994, p. 138) also has asked whether ‚Äúthe language styles purported to describe the African American community represent the entire social field.‚Äù These concerns highlight the ways in which representation has become increasingly important in the study of the dialect. Given the historical landscape of the field, our research must meet the foundational goal of AAVE scholars (documenting the stigmatized speech patterns of African Americans) while also not essentializing or misrepresenting African Americans‚Äô wide array of linguistic practices and identities (King & Rosa 2019). These goals may seem contradictory if we believe that showing variation across the dialect weakens its legitimacy. However, we can still discuss the systematic ways in which language varies among racialized individuals both linguistically and socially while understanding which of those features, or styles, become indexical of blackness and why. An analysis of our theoretical commitments in the broader study of race and language will help us to develop and adopt the necessary analytic tools. Further, an explicit articulation of African Americans‚Äô subjectivity will elucidate how we can study and value linguistic diversity among this population and address the linguistic discrimination faced by its most marginalized and civically vulnerable speakers. 3. THE TRAJECTORY OF AAL 3.1. Understanding the Relationships Between Race and Language What does it mean to study race in sociolinguistics? How has our approach to documenting African Americans‚Äô language patterns evolved across the field? In this review, I draw on knowledge 290 King Annu. Rev. Linguist. 2020.6:285-300. Downloaded from www.annualreviews.org Access provided by Stanford University Main Campus Robert Crown Law Library on 02/18/20. For personal use only. LI06CH14_King ARjats.cls November 27, 2019 15:23 from contiguous fields like linguistic anthropology, sociology, and critical race theory to suggest how we should approach the study of race in sociolinguistics. The changes that have occurred across the study of the dialect reflect the dynamic nature of the field‚Äôs conceptualizations of African American identity and African Americans‚Äô language and the relationship between the two. The recent call for a statement on race within linguistics reflects the felt need of sociolinguists, educators, and linguistic anthropologists for a cohesive model of race in the field (Charity Hudley et al. 2019). While sociolinguists may have understood their research on African Americans‚Äô speech to only concern descriptions of language, they have, perhaps unreflexively, subscribed to particular theories of race and identity and participated in the construction of this racialized language. A review of the field‚Äôs approaches to studying race and language will elucidate the theoretical constructs AAL scholars have employed to analyze and represent African Americans‚Äô speech and will also highlight the consequences of such approaches. The field has two predominant approaches: the dialect orientation and the group orientation (Alim & Reyes 2011). Under the dialect orientation, linguists begin with the dialect and are ‚Äúconcerned with classifying the frequency and distinctiveness of dialect features with respect to some ethnoracial formation‚Äù (Alim & Reyes 2011, p. 380). A hazard of this approach is the one-to-one mapping it creates between the dialect and the racial group: Investigations of the dialect only look at African American speakers.Additional complications extend from earlier critiques regarding the essentialization of African Americans‚Äô speech. If a set of behaviors racialized as African American is defined against an imagined standard, MAE, which is racialized as white, then we foreground interracial comparisons at the cost of exploring intraracial comparisons. The foregrounded point of comparison between AAVE and MAE can obscure the variation within each group and imply that African Americans who are not proficient in ethnolectal patterns do not have legitimate membership in the racial category and are not worthy of study. Sociolinguists have opposed this idea using the caveat that not all speakers of AAVE are black and not all black people are AAVE speakers (Benor 2010, Green 2002). Others have noted that the dialect approach supports outdated taxonomic models of race by assuming a direct relationship between one‚Äôs racial identity and the racialized variety (Charity Hudley 2017, Smedley 1999). This dialect approach favors the ethnolect as a theoretical construct to understand the linguistic behavior of racialized individuals. However, Benor (2010) proposes the ‚Äúethnolinguistic repertoire‚Äù as a means of addressing some of the issues posed by the dialect approach. The linguistic repertoire was first proposed by Gumperz (1964), but in Benor‚Äôs (2010, p. 160) recapitulation of the term, it is defined as a ‚Äúfluid set of linguistic resources that members of an ethnic group may use variably as they index their ethnic identities.‚Äù In an effort to treat ethnic identity as more fluid, this particular theoretical model allows for in-group variation and intraspeaker variation such that speakers can draw on variables from an arsenal of racialized features. Further, this model acknowledges racialized speakers‚Äô agency as they engage in the process of bricolage (Eckert 2000). However, the extent to which the ethnolinguistic repertoire captures the ability of racialized variables to index identities beyond race has been called into question. Becker (2014) argues for a more general approach to the repertoire in her examination of an individual African American woman from Harlem. Becker‚Äôs analyses show that a single speaker can employ any feature from their repertoire, whether ‚Äúethnolectal‚Äù or not, to construct race and a range of other identities. For example, an AAVE feature, like copula deletion, can be used to construct place identity, while a regional feature, like bought raising, can be used to mark racial identity. Becker‚Äôs approach to studying the variables recruited in the identity constructions across an individual speaker is consistent with what Alim & Reyes (2011) call the group orientation. This approach begins with specific ethnoracial information about a group or speaker and examines the emergence of linguistic practices among members of that group. Alim & Reyes (2011, p. 380) note www.annualreviews.org ‚Ä¢ From AAVE to AAL 291 Annu. Rev. Linguist. 2020.6:285-300.

The diagram represents the difference between ( a ) dialect orientation [in this example, studying African American Vernacular English (AAVE)] and ( b ) group orientation (in this example, studying African Americans‚Äô speech). The former approach emphasizes observing the canonical features of a dialect, whereas the latter emphasizes observing the breadth of African Americans‚Äô linguistic practices. The group orientation also demonstrates that the canonical AAVE features can covary with features that are not exclusive to AAVE, producing a range of styles across the racial group. that this approach allows for ‚Äúethnic identity to be produced without an ethnic dialect‚Äù and necessarily changes how we think about African American speakers in relation to linguistic variation. Without presupposing a set of linguistic behaviors that we expect African Americans to follow, we avoid assuming that the speakers who produce the most AAVE patterns give the most authentic performance of African American identity. Figure 1 illustrates the differences between the two approaches with an emphasis on what can be studied using each approach. The difference in the orientations can be reflected in the questions ‚ÄúWho is an AAVE speaker?‚Äù versus ‚ÄúWhat are the linguistic resources African Americans are recruiting in their construction of identities?‚Äù Under the guise of the latter question, the study of African Americans‚Äô speech need not only include features associated with the ethnolect. Highlighting the differences does not negate the initial approach‚Äôs contributions to our understanding of race and language; rather, it is a window into how the racial group is situated in relation to its language patterns. Alim & Reyes (2011) recommend departing from both orientations and transcending the larger macrosocial categories to understand the construction of race and the process of racialization (Charity Hudley 2017). We can learn more about how race is constituted through linguistic practice (Eckert 2000) while also understanding how it informs and is necessarily informed by other dimensions of identity, such as speakers‚Äô age, nationality, gender, and sexuality (Alim & Reyes 2011, p. 381). This change mirrors the larger transition in sociolinguistics from correlating variables with fixed macrosocial categories to studying the ways in which variables come to indirectly index these categories via associated qualities and stances (Eckert 2008, 2012). For AAL to arrive at third-wave variationism, we must draw on the theoretic constructs that view language not as a static like the ethnolect but, rather, as a process of meaning making. That is, we can discuss linguistic variation across African Americans, as well as how specific linguistic patterns have come to be racialized, by drawing on third-wave theoretical constructs like indexicality (Eckert 2008, Silverstein 2003) and the persona (Agha 2003, Podesva 2007, Zhang 2005), which emphasize the 292 King Annu. Rev. Linguist. 2020.6:285-300. Downloaded from www.annualreviews.org Access provided by Stanford University Main Campus Robert Crown Law Library on 02/18/20. For personal use only. LI06CH14_King ARjats.cls November 27, 2019 15:23 social meaning of variables and the ways in which variables combine to produce styles that have become legible as black and African American. These goals fall within the perimeter of raciolinguistics, which seeks to understand how speakers use language to construct race and how race constructs language (Alim et al. 2016, Flores & Rosa 2015). If the primary concern of AAL is to document the breadth of speech among African Americans without homogenizing the speech community, then future studies should investigate the emergence of linguistic variables among African American speakers and identify which of these variables become indexical of race and other co-constructed dimensions of identity.The group orientation provides a starting point to discuss the features associated with African American identity as well as those that are not. This reframing expands our descriptive power for a dialect that, paradoxically, is overrepresented in sociolinguistic literature (Morgan 2002) but underdocumented in terms of its variation across different linguistic domains and social dimensions. One might argue against this approach because it relies on African Americans‚Äô subscribing to taxonomic categories of race by identifying themselves as black. However, part of undoing the singular narrative of blackness relies on discovering the expanse of social and linguistic practices among speakers who identify as black. As a heterogeneous collectivity, African Americans share the experience of being racialized as belonging to the same demographic category, but they need not share the same social constructions of race, and African American individuals can perform their racial identities in diverse ways (Collins 2000, King 2018). Therefore, dismantling stereotypes and raciolinguistic ideologies (Flores & Rosa 2015) requires understanding how the racial category is constituted via social and language variation. 3.2.

How has our approach to documenting African Americans‚Äô language patterns evolved across the field? In this review, I draw on knowledge 290 King Annu. Rev. Linguist. 2020.6:285-300.

LI06CH14_King ARjats.cls November 27, 2019 15:23 from contiguous fields like linguistic anthropology, sociology, and critical race theory to suggest how we should approach the study of race in sociolinguistics. The changes that have occurred across the study of the dialect reflect the dynamic nature of the field‚Äôs conceptualizations of African American identity and African Americans‚Äô language and the relationship between the two. The recent call for a statement on race within linguistics reflects the felt need of sociolinguists, educators, and linguistic anthropologists for a cohesive model of race in the field (Charity Hudley et al. 2019). While sociolinguists may have understood their research on African Americans‚Äô speech to only concern descriptions of language, they have, perhaps unreflexively, subscribed to particular theories of race and identity and participated in the construction of this racialized language. A review of the field‚Äôs approaches to studying race and language will elucidate the theoretical constructs AAL scholars have employed to analyze and represent African Americans‚Äô speech and will also highlight the consequences of such approaches. The field has two predominant approaches: the dialect orientation and the group orientation (Alim & Reyes 2011). Under the dialect orientation, linguists begin with the dialect and are ‚Äúconcerned with classifying the frequency and distinctiveness of dialect features with respect to some ethnoracial formation‚Äù (Alim & Reyes 2011, p. 380). A hazard of this approach is the one-to-one mapping it creates between the dialect and the racial group: Investigations of the dialect only look at African American speakers.Additional complications extend from earlier critiques regarding the essentialization of African Americans‚Äô speech. If a set of behaviors racialized as African American is defined against an imagined standard, MAE, which is racialized as white, then we foreground interracial comparisons at the cost of exploring intraracial comparisons. The foregrounded point of comparison between AAVE and MAE can obscure the variation within each group and imply that African Americans who are not proficient in ethnolectal patterns do not have legitimate membership in the racial category and are not worthy of study. Sociolinguists have opposed this idea using the caveat that not all speakers of AAVE are black and not all black people are AAVE speakers (Benor 2010, Green 2002). Others have noted that the dialect approach supports outdated taxonomic models of race by assuming a direct relationship between one‚Äôs racial identity and the racialized variety (Charity Hudley 2017, Smedley 1999). This dialect approach favors the ethnolect as a theoretical construct to understand the linguistic behavior of racialized individuals. However, Benor (2010) proposes the ‚Äúethnolinguistic repertoire‚Äù as a means of addressing some of the issues posed by the dialect approach. The linguistic repertoire was first proposed by Gumperz (1964), but in Benor‚Äôs (2010, p. 160) recapitulation of the term, it is defined as a ‚Äúfluid set of linguistic resources that members of an ethnic group may use variably as they index their ethnic identities.‚Äù In an effort to treat ethnic identity as more fluid, this particular theoretical model allows for in-group variation and intraspeaker variation such that speakers can draw on variables from an arsenal of racialized features. Further, this model acknowledges racialized speakers‚Äô agency as they engage in the process of bricolage (Eckert 2000). However, the extent to which the ethnolinguistic repertoire captures the ability of racialized variables to index identities beyond race has been called into question. Becker (2014) argues for a more general approach to the repertoire in her examination of an individual African American woman from Harlem. Becker‚Äôs analyses show that a single speaker can employ any feature from their repertoire, whether ‚Äúethnolectal‚Äù or not, to construct race and a range of other identities. For example, an AAVE feature, like copula deletion, can be used to construct place identity, while a regional feature, like bought raising, can be used to mark racial identity. Becker‚Äôs approach to studying the variables recruited in the identity constructions across an individual speaker is consistent with what Alim & Reyes (2011) call the group orientation. This approach begins with specific ethnoracial information about a group or speaker and examines the emergence of linguistic practices among members of that group.

The diagram represents the difference between ( a ) dialect orientation [in this example, studying African American Vernacular English (AAVE)] and ( b ) group orientation (in this example, studying African Americans‚Äô speech). The former approach emphasizes observing the canonical features of a dialect, whereas the latter emphasizes observing the breadth of African Americans‚Äô linguistic practices. The group orientation also demonstrates that the canonical AAVE features can covary with features that are not exclusive to AAVE, producing a range of styles across the racial group. that this approach allows for ‚Äúethnic identity to be produced without an ethnic dialect‚Äù and necessarily changes how we think about African American speakers in relation to linguistic variation. Without presupposing a set of linguistic behaviors that we expect African Americans to follow, we avoid assuming that the speakers who produce the most AAVE patterns give the most authentic performance of African American identity. Figure 1 illustrates the differences between the two approaches with an emphasis on what can be studied using each approach. The difference in the orientations can be reflected in the questions ‚ÄúWho is an AAVE speaker?‚Äù versus ‚ÄúWhat are the linguistic resources African Americans are recruiting in their construction of identities?‚Äù Under the guise of the latter question, the study of African Americans‚Äô speech need not only include features associated with the ethnolect. Highlighting the differences does not negate the initial approach‚Äôs contributions to our understanding of race and language; rather, it is a window into how the racial group is situated in relation to its language patterns. Alim & Reyes (2011) recommend departing from both orientations and transcending the larger macrosocial categories to understand the construction of race and the process of racialization (Charity Hudley 2017). We can learn more about how race is constituted through linguistic practice (Eckert 2000) while also understanding how it informs and is necessarily informed by other dimensions of identity, such as speakers‚Äô age, nationality, gender, and sexuality (Alim & Reyes 2011, p. 381). This change mirrors the larger transition in sociolinguistics from correlating variables with fixed macrosocial categories to studying the ways in which variables come to indirectly index these categories via associated qualities and stances (Eckert 2008, 2012). For AAL to arrive at third-wave variationism, we must draw on the theoretic constructs that view language not as a static like the ethnolect but, rather, as a process of meaning making. That is, we can discuss linguistic variation across African Americans, as well as how specific linguistic patterns have come to be racialized, by drawing on third-wave theoretical constructs like indexicality (Eckert 2008, Silverstein 2003) and the persona (Agha 2003, Podesva 2007, Zhang 2005), which emphasize the 292 King Annu.

LI06CH14_King ARjats.cls November 27, 2019 15:23 social meaning of variables and the ways in which variables combine to produce styles that have become legible as black and African American. These goals fall within the perimeter of raciolinguistics, which seeks to understand how speakers use language to construct race and how race constructs language (Alim et al. 2016, Flores & Rosa 2015). If the primary concern of AAL is to document the breadth of speech among African Americans without homogenizing the speech community, then future studies should investigate the emergence of linguistic variables among African American speakers and identify which of these variables become indexical of race and other co-constructed dimensions of identity.The group orientation provides a starting point to discuss the features associated with African American identity as well as those that are not. This reframing expands our descriptive power for a dialect that, paradoxically, is overrepresented in sociolinguistic literature (Morgan 2002) but underdocumented in terms of its variation across different linguistic domains and social dimensions. One might argue against this approach because it relies on African Americans‚Äô subscribing to taxonomic categories of race by identifying themselves as black. However, part of undoing the singular narrative of blackness relies on discovering the expanse of social and linguistic practices among speakers who identify as black. As a heterogeneous collectivity, African Americans share the experience of being racialized as belonging to the same demographic category, but they need not share the same social constructions of race, and African American individuals can perform their racial identities in diverse ways (Collins 2000, King 2018). Therefore, dismantling stereotypes and raciolinguistic ideologies (Flores & Rosa 2015) requires understanding how the racial category is constituted via social and language variation. 3.2. A Multidimensional Approach Toward Studying Race in AAL Resituating racial groups in relation to their speech changes what subjectivity should look like for African Americans in our analyses. With the emergence of new research questions around the construction of racialized language and racial identities, researchers must reconsider whom and what we investigate, looking beyond the traditionally studied AAVE speakers and beyond AAVE. In essence, we must reconsider which African Americans are represented and investigate linguistic features beyond or in addition to the canonical AAVE variables. This reconsideration affects analytic and methodological approaches to data collection and data analyses (Blake 2014, Charity Hudley 2017).Specifically,ethnographic'

[0]       'The influence of African Americans‚Äô speech on the development of sociolinguistics has been significant since its earliest descriptions within this discipline in the late 1960s (Labov et al. 1968, Wolfram 1969). Rickford (1997b) and others have been critical of the unequal partnership between researchers of African American Vernacular English (AAVE) and African American speech communities given the myriad of theoretical innovations that data from AAVE speakers have contributed to the field. Some examples include ‚Äúthe development of variable rules and frameworks for the analysis of tense-aspect markers, social class, styles, narratives, and speech events‚Äù (Rickford 1997b, p. 161). Despite the field‚Äôs generation of these theoretical and analytic tools, much remains to be gleaned from our observations of these communities, and much remains to be returned to them. Specifically, we should document and represent the language patterns of the African American community more broadly while also implementing various social justice aims. The need to reconsider our scholarly approaches to racialized varieties like African American Language (AAL), and to include and consider more racialized participants in the process of knowledge production, is evident in the Linguistic Society of America‚Äôs move to craft a Statement on Race addressing these goals (Charity Hudley et al. 2019). Toward this end, the goal of this review is to rethink the relationship between race and language via the study of AAVE and thereby address broader sociolinguistic and sociopolitical concerns. To understand the relationship between race and language in the field, I trace what Wolfram (2015) has called ‚Äúthe sociolinguistic construction of African American Language.‚Äù I discuss the field‚Äôs larger objectives and controversies while also considering the subjectivity of racialized participants. A bird‚Äôs eye view of how African Americans have been historically situated in relation to the variety will inform the new questions we develop as well as the kinds of approaches we use to answer them. Specifically, we can ask how to relate scholars‚Äô larger goals of AAL and sociolinguistics to the goals of the African American communities in which we are engaged (Charity Hudley 2017). 2. THE HISTORICAL LANDSCAPE 2.1. Labeling the Variety A review of the field‚Äôs approaches to studying African Americans‚Äô speech should first address linguists‚Äô naming practices of the variety over the last five decades. Various titles of the dialect will carry different kinds of ideological baggage that necessarily interact with the changing social climate (Green 2002, Smitherman 1991, Wassink & Curzan 2004). Broadly, the name used for the dialect serves three functions: identifying the racial group whose language production is being described, indicating the variety‚Äôs relationship to English and creoles, and specifying the subset of African Americans whose language is being characterized (Green 2002). With respect to the first function, the name can reflect how members of the racial group are referenced or refer to themselves. For instance, earlier versions of the variety, such as Negro dialect, Nonstandard Negro English, and Negro English, enlist an identifying term that has become obsolete as speakers have opted for black or African American. As such, the identifying terms used by members of the racial group under',
      'are mixed, with African Americans rejecting or adopting various aspects of the regional dialect and some speakers taking up the vocalic patterns more than others in their communities. 2.3. Against the Uniformity Assumption Earlier explorations of AAVE aimed to legitimize the variety by packaging a particular set of linguistic variables racialized as black. Referencing such linguistic behavior as a single object of study enabled sociolinguists to address linguistic discrimination that black people faced in education, housing, employment, and law settings. Sociolinguists believed that by showing systematic and cross-regional patterns, they could combat claims that this speech style was ungrammatical. Under these approaches, the sociolinguistic construction of AAVE relied on the presentation of a uniform, systematic dialect. However, more recent approaches aimed at understanding the development and change of the dialect over time have begun to elucidate the variation. The new observations that emerged from using these new techniques led to the critique that sociolinguists were homogenizing the linguistic practices and identities of African Americans across and within speech communities and problematized the notion that sociolinguists were studying a single www.annualreviews.org ‚Ä¢ From AAVE to AAL 289 Annu.

LI06CH14_King ARjats.cls November 27, 2019 15:23 dialect (Wolfram 2007). Despite sociolinguists‚Äô good intentions, some of their generalizations about African Americans‚Äô speech had unintended consequences. As Bucholtz (2003, p. 402) notes, But the recognition of AAVE and its speakers necessitated a series of simplifications that reduced the complexity of AAVE users to a subset of the entire community and reduced the complexity of African American language use to a subset of the community‚Äôs entire repertoire. Such simplifications were certainly not intended to be the full story but instead functioned as strategies that allowed sociolinguists to intervene in a high-stakes sociopolitical issue despite very real constraints. The issue of homogenization is a question of whose speech is considered representative of the black experience. As is evident in earlier instantiations of the dialect‚Äôs name, researchers were aiming to study a specific sample of the African American population: young people in inner cities, especially young men (Labov 1972). Thus, AAVE‚Äôs close association with working-class, black, male identity is no surprise given our field‚Äôs foundational studies, which reflect our larger society‚Äôs beliefs about who speaks AAVE. Put differently, the fact that the speech of young black men from inner cities defines the field says as much about conceptualizations of what blackness is as it does about who is seen as the most authentic speaker of the variety. This construction of the ideal or imagined speaker is meaningful and cannot be divorced from the ways in which those speakers are positioned in the society. As Wassink & Curzan (2004, p. 181) describe, ‚Äú‚ÄòYoung, Black, male, and dangerous‚Äô continues to be an important social construct for dominant America. Many Americans hold an ideology that marks that construct by associating it with a way of speaking, among other behaviors.‚Äù The critique of older approaches‚Äô centering of African American male experiences was advanced as early as the late 1980s when Smitherman (1988) argued against overrepresenting young black men at the expense of studying black women‚Äôs linguistic behavior. Further, the continued focus on negative aspects of street culture reinforced negative stereotypes associated with African Americans (Rickford 1997b, Smitherman 1988). Morgan (1994, p. 138) also has asked whether ‚Äúthe language styles purported to describe the African American community represent the entire social field.‚Äù These concerns highlight the ways in which representation has become increasingly important in the study of the dialect. Given the historical landscape of the field, our research must meet the foundational goal of AAVE scholars (documenting the stigmatized speech patterns of African Americans) while also not essentializing or misrepresenting African Americans‚Äô wide array of linguistic practices and identities (King & Rosa 2019). These goals may seem contradictory if we believe that showing variation across the dialect weakens its legitimacy. However, we can still discuss the systematic ways in which language varies among racialized individuals both linguistically and socially while understanding which of those features, or styles, become indexical of blackness and why. An analysis of our theoretical commitments in the broader study of race and language will help us to develop and adopt the necessary analytic tools. Further, an explicit articulation of African Americans‚Äô subjectivity will elucidate how we can study and value linguistic diversity among this population and address the linguistic discrimination faced by its most marginalized and civically vulnerable speakers. 3.

Broadly, the name used for the dialect serves three functions: identifying the racial group whose language production is being described, indicating the variety‚Äôs relationship to English and creoles, and specifying the subset of African Americans whose language is being characterized (Green 2002). With respect to the first function, the name can reflect how members of the racial group are referenced or refer to themselves. For instance, earlier versions of the variety, such as Negro dialect, Nonstandard Negro English, and Negro English, enlist an identifying term that has become obsolete as speakers have opted for black or African American. As such, the identifying terms used by members of the racial group under',
      'are mixed, with African Americans rejecting or adopting various aspects of the regional dialect and some speakers taking up the vocalic patterns more than others in their communities. 2.3. Against the Uniformity Assumption Earlier explorations of AAVE aimed to legitimize the variety by packaging a particular set of linguistic variables racialized as black. Referencing such linguistic behavior as a single object of study enabled sociolinguists to address linguistic discrimination that black people faced in education, housing, employment, and law settings. Sociolinguists believed that by showing systematic and cross-regional patterns, they could combat claims that this speech style was ungrammatical. Under these approaches, the sociolinguistic construction of AAVE relied on the presentation of a uniform, systematic dialect. However, more recent approaches aimed at understanding the development and change of the dialect over time have begun to elucidate the variation. The new observations that emerged from using these new techniques led to the critique that sociolinguists were homogenizing the linguistic practices and identities of African Americans across and within speech communities and problematized the notion that sociolinguists were studying a single www.annualreviews.org ‚Ä¢ From AAVE to AAL 289 Annu.

Despite sociolinguists‚Äô good intentions, some of their generalizations about African Americans‚Äô speech had unintended consequences. As Bucholtz (2003, p. 402) notes, But the recognition of AAVE and its speakers necessitated a series of simplifications that reduced the complexity of AAVE users to a subset of the entire community and reduced the complexity of African American language use to a subset of the community‚Äôs entire repertoire. Such simplifications were certainly not intended to be the full story but instead functioned as strategies that allowed sociolinguists to intervene in a high-stakes sociopolitical issue despite very real constraints. The issue of homogenization is a question of whose speech is considered representative of the black experience. As is evident in earlier instantiations of the dialect‚Äôs name, researchers were aiming to study a specific sample of the African American population: young people in inner cities, especially young men (Labov 1972). Thus, AAVE‚Äôs close association with working-class, black, male identity is no surprise given our field‚Äôs foundational studies, which reflect our larger society‚Äôs beliefs about who speaks AAVE. Put differently, the fact that the speech of young black men from inner cities defines the field says as much about conceptualizations of what blackness is as it does about who is seen as the most authentic speaker of the variety. This construction of the ideal or imagined speaker is meaningful and cannot be divorced from the ways in which those speakers are positioned in the society. As Wassink & Curzan (2004, p. 181) describe, ‚Äú‚ÄòYoung, Black, male, and dangerous‚Äô continues to be an important social construct for dominant America. Many Americans hold an ideology that marks that construct by associating it with a way of speaking, among other behaviors.‚Äù The critique of older approaches‚Äô centering of African American male experiences was advanced as early as the late 1980s when Smitherman (1988) argued against overrepresenting young black men at the expense of studying black women‚Äôs linguistic behavior. Further, the continued focus on negative aspects of street culture reinforced negative stereotypes associated with African Americans (Rickford 1997b, Smitherman 1988). Morgan (1994, p. 138) also has asked whether ‚Äúthe language styles purported to describe the African American community represent the entire social field.‚Äù These concerns highlight the ways in which representation has become increasingly important in the study of the dialect. Given the historical landscape of the field, our research must meet the foundational goal of AAVE scholars (documenting the stigmatized speech patterns of African Americans) while also not essentializing or misrepresenting African Americans‚Äô wide array of linguistic practices and identities (King & Rosa 2019). These goals may seem contradictory if we believe that showing variation across the dialect weakens its legitimacy. However, we can still discuss the systematic ways in which language varies among racialized individuals both linguistically and socially while understanding which of those features, or styles, become indexical of blackness and why. An analysis of our theoretical commitments in the broader study of race and language will help us to develop and adopt the necessary analytic tools. Further, an explicit articulation of African Americans‚Äô subjectivity will elucidate how we can study and value linguistic diversity among this population and address the linguistic discrimination faced by its most marginalized and civically vulnerable speakers. 3. THE TRAJECTORY OF AAL 3.1. Understanding the Relationships Between Race and Language What does it mean to study race in sociolinguistics? How has our approach to documenting African Americans‚Äô language patterns evolved across the field? In this review, I draw on knowledge 290 King Annu. Rev. Linguist. 2020.6:285-300. Downloaded from www.annualreviews.org Access provided by Stanford University Main Campus Robert Crown Law Library on 02/18/20. For personal use only. LI06CH14_King ARjats.cls November 27, 2019 15:23 from contiguous fields like linguistic anthropology, sociology, and critical race theory to suggest how we should approach the study of race in sociolinguistics. The changes that have occurred across the study of the dialect reflect the dynamic nature of the field‚Äôs conceptualizations of African American identity and African Americans‚Äô language and the relationship between the two. The recent call for a statement on race within linguistics reflects the felt need of sociolinguists, educators, and linguistic anthropologists for a cohesive model of race in the field (Charity Hudley et al. 2019). While sociolinguists may have understood their research on African Americans‚Äô speech to only concern descriptions of language, they have, perhaps unreflexively, subscribed to particular theories of race and identity and participated in the construction of this racialized language. A review of the field‚Äôs approaches to studying race and language will elucidate the theoretical constructs AAL scholars have employed to analyze and represent African Americans‚Äô speech and will also highlight the consequences of such approaches. The field has two predominant approaches: the dialect orientation and the group orientation (Alim & Reyes 2011). Under the dialect orientation, linguists begin with the dialect and are ‚Äúconcerned with classifying the frequency and distinctiveness of dialect features with respect to some ethnoracial formation‚Äù (Alim & Reyes 2011, p. 380). A hazard of this approach is the one-to-one mapping it creates between the dialect and the racial group: Investigations of the dialect only look at African American speakers.Additional complications extend from earlier critiques regarding the essentialization of African Americans‚Äô speech. If a set of behaviors racialized as African American is defined against an imagined standard, MAE, which is racialized as white, then we foreground interracial comparisons at the cost of exploring intraracial comparisons. The foregrounded point of comparison between AAVE and MAE can obscure the variation within each group and imply that African Americans who are not proficient in ethnolectal patterns do not have legitimate membership in the racial category and are not worthy of study. Sociolinguists have opposed this idea using the caveat that not all speakers of AAVE are black and not all black people are AAVE speakers (Benor 2010, Green 2002). Others have noted that the dialect approach supports outdated taxonomic models of race by assuming a direct relationship between one‚Äôs racial identity and the racialized variety (Charity Hudley 2017, Smedley 1999). This dialect approach favors the ethnolect as a theoretical construct to understand the linguistic behavior of racialized individuals. However, Benor (2010) proposes the ‚Äúethnolinguistic repertoire‚Äù as a means of addressing some of the issues posed by the dialect approach. The linguistic repertoire was first proposed by Gumperz (1964), but in Benor‚Äôs (2010, p. 160) recapitulation of the term, it is defined as a ‚Äúfluid set of linguistic resources that members of an ethnic group may use variably as they index their ethnic identities.‚Äù In an effort to treat ethnic identity as more fluid, this particular theoretical model allows for in-group variation and intraspeaker variation such that speakers can draw on variables from an arsenal of racialized features. Further, this model acknowledges racialized speakers‚Äô agency as they engage in the process of bricolage (Eckert 2000). However, the extent to which the ethnolinguistic repertoire captures the ability of racialized variables to index identities beyond race has been called into question. Becker (2014) argues for a more general approach to the repertoire in her examination of an individual African American woman from Harlem. Becker‚Äôs analyses show that a single speaker can employ any feature from their repertoire, whether ‚Äúethnolectal‚Äù or not, to construct race and a range of other identities. For example, an AAVE feature, like copula deletion, can be used to construct place identity, while a regional feature, like bought raising, can be used to mark racial identity. Becker‚Äôs approach to studying the variables recruited in the identity constructions across an individual speaker is consistent with what Alim & Reyes (2011) call the group orientation. This approach begins with specific ethnoracial information about a group or speaker and examines the emergence of linguistic practices among members of that group.

The diagram represents the difference between ( a ) dialect orientation [in this example, studying African American Vernacular English (AAVE)] and ( b ) group orientation (in this example, studying African Americans‚Äô speech). The former approach emphasizes observing the canonical features of a dialect, whereas the latter emphasizes observing the breadth of African Americans‚Äô linguistic practices. The group orientation also demonstrates that the canonical AAVE features can covary with features that are not exclusive to AAVE, producing a range of styles across the racial group. that this approach allows for ‚Äúethnic identity to be produced without an ethnic dialect‚Äù and necessarily changes how we think about African American speakers in relation to linguistic variation. Without presupposing a set of linguistic behaviors that we expect African Americans to follow, we avoid assuming that the speakers who produce the most AAVE patterns give the most authentic performance of African American identity. Figure 1 illustrates the differences between the two approaches with an emphasis on what can be studied using each approach. The difference in the orientations can be reflected in the questions ‚ÄúWho is an AAVE speaker?‚Äù versus ‚ÄúWhat are the linguistic resources African Americans are recruiting in their construction of identities?‚Äù Under the guise of the latter question, the study of African Americans‚Äô speech need not only include features associated with the ethnolect. Highlighting the differences does not negate the initial approach‚Äôs contributions to our understanding of race and language; rather, it is a window into how the racial group is situated in relation to its language patterns. Alim & Reyes (2011) recommend departing from both orientations and transcending the larger macrosocial categories to understand the construction of race and the process of racialization (Charity Hudley 2017). We can learn more about how race is constituted through linguistic practice (Eckert 2000) while also understanding how it informs and is necessarily informed by other dimensions of identity, such as speakers‚Äô age, nationality, gender, and sexuality (Alim & Reyes 2011, p. 381). This change mirrors the larger transition in sociolinguistics from correlating variables with fixed macrosocial categories to studying the ways in which variables come to indirectly index these categories via associated qualities and stances (Eckert 2008, 2012). For AAL to arrive at third-wave variationism, we must draw on the theoretic constructs that view language not as a static like the ethnolect but, rather, as a process of meaning making. That is, we can discuss linguistic variation across African Americans, as well as how specific linguistic patterns have come to be racialized, by drawing on third-wave theoretical constructs like indexicality (Eckert 2008, Silverstein 2003) and the persona (Agha 2003, Podesva 2007, Zhang 2005), which emphasize the 292 King Annu. Rev. Linguist. 2020.6:285-300. Downloaded from www.annualreviews.org Access provided by Stanford University Main Campus Robert Crown Law Library on 02/18/20. For personal use only. LI06CH14_King ARjats.cls November 27, 2019 15:23 social meaning of variables and the ways in which variables combine to produce styles that have become legible as black and African American. These goals fall within the perimeter of raciolinguistics, which seeks to understand how speakers use language to construct race and how race constructs language (Alim et al. 2016, Flores & Rosa 2015). If the primary concern of AAL is to document the breadth of speech among African Americans without homogenizing the speech community, then future studies should investigate the emergence of linguistic variables among African American speakers and identify which of these variables become indexical of race and other co-constructed dimensions of identity.The group orientation provides a starting point to discuss the features associated with African American identity as well as those that are not. This reframing expands our descriptive power for a dialect that, paradoxically, is overrepresented in sociolinguistic literature (Morgan 2002) but underdocumented in terms of its variation across different linguistic domains and social dimensions. One might argue against this approach because it relies on African Americans‚Äô subscribing to taxonomic categories of race by identifying themselves as black. However, part of undoing the singular narrative of blackness relies on discovering the expanse of social and linguistic practices among speakers who identify as black. As a heterogeneous collectivity, African Americans share the experience of being racialized as belonging to the same demographic category, but they need not share the same social constructions of race, and African American individuals can perform their racial identities in diverse ways (Collins 2000, King 2018). Therefore, dismantling stereotypes and raciolinguistic ideologies (Flores & Rosa 2015) requires understanding how the racial category is constituted via social and language variation. 3.2. A Multidimensional Approach Toward Studying Race in AAL Resituating racial groups in relation to their speech changes what subjectivity should look like for African Americans in our analyses. With the emergence of new research questions around the construction of racialized language and racial identities, researchers must reconsider whom and what we investigate, looking beyond the traditionally studied AAVE speakers and beyond AAVE. In essence, we must reconsider which African Americans are represented and investigate linguistic features beyond or in addition to the canonical AAVE variables. This reconsideration affects analytic and methodological approaches to data collection and data analyses (Blake 2014, Charity Hudley 2017).Specifically,ethnographic'

Its most recent designation, African American Language (AAL), reflects a change in approaches to studying race and language in the field. Drawing on observations from related fields like linguistic anthropology and critical race theory, I discuss different conceptualizations of the relationship between race and language and argue in favor of an approach that both recognizes and prioritizes the study of variation within the dialect. This approach will enable researchers to advance theory in language variation and change while also contributing to larger sociopolitical objectives to diversify narratives of blackness. 285 Annu.
